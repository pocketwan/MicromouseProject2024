A micromouse is an electro-mechanical robot that is designed to find the shortest path in a maze without hitting the walls of the maze. The micromouse consists of a power subsystem which enables the micromouse to move forwards or backwards in the maze and to turn left or right. It also consists of a sensing subsystem which enables the micromouse to detect the walls of the maze in order to avoid hitting them. The scope of this project is to design and manufacture the power and the sensing subsystems of the micromouse that will assist the micromouse in navigating through the maze. This project forms part of a larger project which entails designing an algorithm that will enable a micromouse to determine the shortest path in a maze with dead ends and multiple paths to the finishing point.
